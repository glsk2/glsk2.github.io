            <li><strong>c. 1920</strong> - Benito Armengol moved his family and his lively 11-year old son to a larger, elegant house having amassed a considerable fortune during the Great War (1914-1918) producing cloth for the Allied armies. </li>
            <li><strong>c. 1928</strong> - 1920s Paris and its dynamic artistic community drew
            Armengol like a magnet. He enrolled at an arts
            academy to continue his Fine Art studies. </li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - At the outbreak of the Civil War, Armengol's loyalties remained with the elected Republican Government.  Life became unsettled and precarious for the young couple, and Armengol's family.</li>        
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Shortly before General Francisco Franco came to power Armengol's parents and his siblings fled to Mexico, where he father re-established an industrial base. His wife stayed despite the volcanic political situation.</li>        
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - Armengol and the 13th Demi-Brigade was posted to Scotland by the Foreign Legion headquarters in Marseilles, France.  Here, the Brigade joined Polish and British troops to form the Allied Expeditionary Force, and was sent to help to liberate Norway as part of the ill-fated Narvik campaign.</li>      
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - On 20th February the refugee Armengol, one of thousands of displaced people from across Europe, was granted official leave to stay in Britain.  He and two fellow refugees, Juan and Agustyn, an Armenian Jewish jewellery designer, were befriended by Francisco Madariaga, a restaurateur and leading member Liverpool's long-established Spanish Basque community.</li>        
            <li><strong>1951</strong> - Armengol produced designs for the Festival of Britain, a post-war celebration of the country's new future. These included plastic sculptures in transparent Perspex. This new material - Perspex - was produced by ICI (Imperial chemical Industries). Armengol was one of the first artists to work with it creatively.
 </li>
            
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - Armengol died in Nottingham on 27 November, and was buried in Radcliffe on Trent. Scores of old friends attended his funeral, an event worthy of his celebrity, with fine orations, and several obituaries.</li>
